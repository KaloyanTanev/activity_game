# Activity game

A fun game where players divide into teams, each player puts some words in a hidden box. Then they pick a random word and describe it their temmates, after they guessed it, they can pick another one until their time is over. They can also skip the word. This goes on until all the words are gone.

1. Run `start.exe` (or `start`, depending on your distribution) and select number of players and how many words per player.
2. Run `round.exe` (or `round`, depending on your distribution) and choose the time in seconds each player has.
3. A word will pop up.
If you guess it press enter.
If you want to skip it, type "n" and then enter.
4. When your turn is over, it's next player's turn.
5. As soon as all the words are guessed, the round is over.
